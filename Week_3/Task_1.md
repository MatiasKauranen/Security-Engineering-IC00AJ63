# Task 1: Lock-ins
In this week's course material, you might have heard about concept of lock-ins, often differentiated into technological and vendor lock-ins. Provide a brief summary of each type of lock-in. Feel free to share any personal insights you may have regarding your own experiences with these lock-ins. Additionally, discuss the potential costs associated with breaking free from these lock-ins and the advantages and disadvantages of remaining within them.

Aim for around 150-200 words in your answer and list sources used.


## Technological lock-in
Technological lock-in refers to a situation in which particular prevalent technologies become hard and expensive to switch out or exit. As a result, people are stuck using them for longer periods of time even though there are many better and effective alternatives on the market. This effectively slows down technological development since it's harder to switch for a little bit of improvement. However, only when an alternative has become greatly more effective than the original is it time to start calculating the costs of exiting technological lock-in.

One of the better-known cases of technological lock-in that everyone can relate to is the QWERTY keyboard. The QWERTY keyboard became so dominant in its field that every other option became very unsuccessful. Some researchers claim that use of a Dvorak keyboard could be over 10% faster; however, nobody is willing to give up their QWERTY keyboard since it has become the norm.

## Vendor lock-in

Vendor lock-in refers to a situation in which switching to an alternative vendor costs so much more that the customer or company can't do it, and will be stuck with the current vendor.
This is prevalent in today's cloud computing market. Microsoft, Amazon and Google hold most of the cloud market, which makes competition very fierce. It's easy to become locked into a certain cloud provider since, for example, database environments are unique and transferring and reformatting data can be hard and expensive. For businesses, it's usually easier to use the current vendor which is more expensive / inferior provider than make costly effort to try change vendor in hopes of savings in longer period of time.
