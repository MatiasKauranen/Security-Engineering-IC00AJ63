# Task2: Security Psychology

Familiarize yourself with definitions for following; cognitive-, behavioral- and social psychology, course material and search engines are your friends! using one or multiple of them, explain your rationale for following phenomena:

why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice?  
why social engineering works on people?  
why many people have hard time using passwords in secure way?  
why it is so easy to spread malware?  

No strict length requirements, but aim for 100+ words per question. 400-500 words for the whole task overall.


## Why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice?
There's a lack of training and awareness regarding phishing attacks. Attackers exploit this weakness, often combined with posing as authority figures like the police, since in Western countries trust in authorities is high. Phishing attacks often use cases of emergency as a way to make unsuspecting victims act without thinking first. For example, a phishing attack may claim that a victim's bank account will be deactivated shortly if they donâ€™t provide their login data immediately.

## Why social engineering works on people?
Humans, like all other species, have tendencies and predictable behaviors in decision-making that attackers try to manipulate. The aim of social engineering is to make people do things that they normally wouldn't do under certain circumstances. There are many kinds of social engineering, such as trust in authority, FOMO (fear of missing out), and exploiting the natural desire to be helpful.

## Why many people have hard time using passwords in secure way?
There are various reasons for the lack of strong passwords in today's world. One common reason is the need for habits. Oftentimes, people use the same password for multiple sites because it has become a similar habit as typing the same email address on every login page. Some people experience password fatigue due to having dozens of websites with different passwords, and when logging in becomes bothersome, they give up instead of utilizing tools such as password managers.

## Why it is so easy to spread malware?
Malware is easy to spread because it exploits weaknesses in humans and machines simultaneously. In recent times, crafting convincing phishing emails has become more efficient due to the use of artificial intelligence, which can translate messages into most languages of the world very effectively. Spreading malware is easy since it can be distributed in large quantities, and even if only a small fraction of attacks succeed, the infected devices can be used to access and spread to many more machines through their networks.
