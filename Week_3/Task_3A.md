# Task3A: Intellectual Rights

Companies prioritize safeguarding their assets, encompassing both tangible and intangible aspects. This protection involves utilizing legal mechanisms like:

    Intellectual Property (IP)
    Copyright
    Patent
    Trademark
    Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)

Along with employing technologies such as:

    Watermarks
    Software licenses
    Digital rights management (DRM)
    Software protection dongles

Please provide a brief explanation of each mentioned safeguarding method and cite any known use cases for each. Notice that subjects have some overlap, feel free to format your answer in a convenient way

## Intellectual Property (IP)
IP is a property of the mind, such as symbols, patents, designs, and much more. An example of IP would be Adidas: having one or two stripes is fine, but if there are three stripes, then that's the IP of Adidas.

## Copyright
Copyright is legal protection for works such as music, books, movies, and software. It prevents copying or sharing without permission. An example would be YouTube: if you use music in your videos and you don't have copyright, then your video will most likely be taken down by a copyright claim.

## Patent
A patent gives its inventor exclusive rights to make, use, or sell the invention for a limited period of time. A famous example is Alfred Nobel, who invented and patented dynamite and became rich in the process. Companies that tried to duplicate the dynamite were stopped quickly.

## Trademark
A trademark refers to company identifiers such as logos, names, and slogans. A well-known example would be Nike's slogan "Just Do It".

## Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)
NDAs are contracts in which participants promise not to spread confidential information shared in private meetings. For example, an employee might have to sign an NDA to not share any vital business information with competitors.

## Watermarks
A watermark is a visible or invisible mark in digital content to indicate ownership and prevent usage by unauthorized parties. They are often used by stock photo websites to stop unauthorized use of photos. The only way to legally remove a watermark is to purchase the image.

## Software licenses
A software license determines who can use the software, how, and for how long. It is designed to protect the rights of developers and prevent unauthorized usage. A well-known example is Microsoft Word and many photo editing software programs that sell licenses.

## Digital Rights Management (DRM)
DRM refers to technologies that control access to and usage of digital content. Many PC video games nowadays have DRM protection, which can prevent offline playing to stop piracy. However, these are often unpopular with users in this format.

## Software protection dongles
A software protection dongle is a physical device, such as a USB device, which must be used to run the software. AutoCAD and some other expensive enterprise-level software utilize dongles to prevent illegal use of the software.
