## Freedom of Information: DRM and Software Licenses
In recent years, the ownership of digital content has been widely debated. Many people argue that owning digital content—a game, for example—should work in a similar fashion to owning a physical game; however, this is not the case. Many gaming platforms and publishers use DRM to ensure the product is used legally, but this is not without drawbacks. DRM has many limitations. For example, with "Always-on DRM," the user must be connected to a server at all times to access the product. If you live in an area with a poor connection, if the connection drops, or if the DRM server experiences issues, you will not be able to use the product you supposedly "own." Pirates will find ways to bypass Always-on DRM, so it is usually the honest paying customers who suffer the most. It can be argued that the use of DRM is not efficient and may have the opposite effect: it can be easier to illegally download a game than to legally purchase it and then encounter DRM issues.

Many people who buy digital content, such as movies and games, from digital providers have discovered that they do not actually own the movies or games but only the software license to use these products. Having a software license is much weaker than having true ownership. You can sell a physical copy, so why couldn’t you sell a digital copy? Many argue that if buying is not owning, then why is pirating considered stealing? Your license can also be revoked, or the service discontinued, without warning. In recent years, the collection of physical DVDs has increased due to the uncertainty of digital ownership. Many people hope that owning digital content is as reliable as having physical DvD on your shelf.

In conclusion, DRM and software licenses demonstrates the battle between company control of digital content and people’s desire for ownership, control, and the ability to use content they purchase. This debate highlights the need for clear and fair policies for creators and consumers alike.
