# Task 1: Measures Taken to Protect Against Cyber Crimes

Write a short description of the actions you have done to fortify your defenses towards all sorts of cyber crimes, including possible servers and accounts you have. Please keep in mind not to include any specific details, such as passwords or tokens.

Have you been a victim of cyber crimes and do you think you could have prevented them? For example phishing and malware attacks. What could you improve on?

Please keep your answer concise, bullet points are acceptable, but remember to answer atleast all mentioned topics.


## Personal Cybersecurity Measures
- Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication if possible.  
- Regularly update software, operating systems, and applications to patch vulnerabilities.  
- Use antivirus and anti-malware solutions on personal devices.  
- Avoid suspicious links, emails, and downloads to prevent phishing and malware attacks.  
- Limit sharing of personal information online and review privacy settings on social media and accounts.  

## Experience with Cyber Crimes
I have experienced phishing attempts by people pretending to be my colleagues and trying to get my personal data. These attempts were avoided by verifying sender details and blacklisting their email address, and not clicking any suspicious links in their email. Hard to prevent these completely so real solution is to be vigilant when someone wants something through email.

## Areas for Improvement
- Changing password regulary, even strong password can leak through data breaches.
- Having same password for multiple sites, As mentioned before even strong password can still leak through data breach and risks multiple accounts at once.
