# Task 3A: Threat Dragon (1p)
Threat Dragon is an OSS tool used to create threat model diagrams(see image below). The tool very specifically does **not** try to do too much on its own, rather gives control to the user and encourages their own thinking, as they should thoroughly analyse the system they are working on. 

In this task we are using the second version, it's documentation is [here](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/docs-2/install-options/). You may use your preferred method for installation, they are very similar, but we recommend **the desktop application,** as it stores the models on the local file system. First go through a bit of the documentation to get acquainted with the tool. Then you will be analysing a ready made flawed model, and you should find pain points and fix the model. The model is *"Student_website_Threat_Model.json"* in the threat dragon repository, there you will also find an example of how the report looks like without threats. Below you will find minimum requirements and a system description.
