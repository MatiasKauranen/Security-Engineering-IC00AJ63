# Task 2: Company Security Policy

Pick two topics from the list below to write a security policy on. An effort should be made to include one policy on one A4 page.
Topics

    Password policy
    Physical access policy
    Cloud usage/security policy
    System authentication policy
    Network perimeter security policy
    Social media security policy
    BYOD(Bring Your Own Device) policy
    General purpose information security policy

These policies are to be kept quite straight-forward and easily understandable for any employee, this includes explaining certain not well-known topics, for example a VPN or a network perimeter. The second lecture "Threat Models and Security Policies" gives very good advice on how to write sensible policies.

You should also check this for detailed advice and explanation on for example types of policies. For example chapter 5.2.2 gives good insight on what basic components are good for issue-specific policies. You don't have to contain yourself to just text, you may include for example pictures and data-flow charts where beneficial.

## Topic 1: Password Policy

Issue Statement:  
Passwords are the first line of defense in protecting company systems, data, and services from unauthorized access. Weak or reused passwords are a common cause of security breaches. This policy sets the rules for creating, using, and managing passwords to protect both the organization and employees.

Organization’s Position:  
All employees must use strong, unique passwords for company systems. Passwords must never be shared, written down in visible places, or reused across different work accounts. Password managers, which are tools that safely store and generate passwords, are allowed and encouraged for convenience and security.

Applicability  
This policy applies to:  
- All employees, contractors, and interns using company-owned systems or services.
- All company systems, including email, internal software, cloud services, and VPN (Virtual Private Network – a secure “tunnel” for connecting remotely).

Roles and Responsibilities:  
- Employees: Responsible for creating and maintaining secure passwords and protecting them from disclosure.
- IT Department: Provides guidance on password requirements, manages resets, and enforces technical controls such as lockouts after repeated failed attempts.
- Managers: Ensure their teams comply with this policy.

Password Requirements:  
- Minimum length: 12 characters.
- Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Passwords must not include easily guessable info (e.g., your name, birth date, “password123”).
- Must not be reused across multiple company accounts.
- Change passwords at least every 12 months or immediately if compromise is suspected.

Compliance:  
- Accounts may be locked after repeated failed login attempts.
- Non-compliance (e.g., sharing passwords, using weak ones) may result in disciplinary actions.

Point of Contact:  
- Questions or support requests should be directed to the IT Security Team


## Topic 2: Social Media Security Policy

Issue Statement:    
Social media is a powerful tool for communication but can also expose the organization to risks such as data leaks, phishing, and reputational damage. This policy establishes guidelines for responsible use of social media by employees.

Organization’s Position:  
Employees may use social media for personal purposes, but they must not share confidential company information, customer details, or internal documents. When posting about the company, employees must act responsibly and clearly state personal opinions as their own.

Applicability  
This policy applies to:  
- All employees and contractors, whether using personal or company devices.
- Use of all social media platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok).

Roles and Responsibilities:  
- Employees: Must ensure their posts do not harm the company’s reputation or disclose sensitive data.
- Communications Team: Manages official company accounts and is the only authority allowed to make official company statements online.
- Managers: Monitor and remind team members of acceptable use practices.

Social Media Guidelines:  
- Do not post company data, customer info, or internal projects.
- Do not engage in arguments or hostile behavior while representing the company.
- Be cautious of phishing attempts (e.g., fake messages asking for login credentials).
- When in doubt, check before posting.
- Use a VPN when accessing social media on public Wi-Fi to protect your login details from attackers.

Compliance:  
- Violations (e.g., leaking sensitive data) may result in disciplinary action.

Point of Contact:  
- For questions about acceptable use, contact the Communications Team or IT Security Team.
