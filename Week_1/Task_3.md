# Task 3: Threat Modelling

Recommended to check out this very tight package on threat modelling. [The privacyguides' threat modelling info package.](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/threat-modeling/) 

Here's the essential points you can find in the above link:

## Identify your assets. WHAT do you want to protect?
- Personal devices
- Company devices
- Private messages
- Emails
- Location data
- Accounts and passwords

## Who are your potential adversaries. WHO do you want to protect from?
- Advertisers and data brokers
- Hackers
- Thieves
- Other criminals

## Assess the threats and likelyhoods of them for each of your assets. How LIKELY is it that you will need to protect it?
- Advertisers and data brokers → medium
- Hackers on public Wi-Fi → low
- Thieves stealing phone or laptop → low

## Evaluate impact if an asset is compromised. How bad are the CONSEQUENCES if you fail?
- Online banking hacked → high financial loss
- Phone lost → device cost + personal data exposure
- Work laptop stolen → high career consequences

## Cost. How much trouble and time are you willing to spend to prevent the consequences?
- Password managers & MFA → low effort
- Removing all social media accounts → too restrictive
- Using VPN connection → not free
- Avoiding public spaces (e.g. restaurants, public transport) when possessing company devices → too restrictive

## Mitigate or mitigation plan; determine what you can do now and what to do if compromised.
- Use a password manager + strong unique passwords.
- Enable MFA on banking and email accounts.
- Use Signal for private chats
- Contact bank immediately if account compromised
