# Task 1A: Browsers and Banking Security
Online Banking is of the most lucrative targets for phishing and scams. How do our browsers protect us against them?
Questions:

## What does the "Not Secure" warning mean in the first picture and what risks does visiting sites with the warning pose?
The "Not Secure" warning in a browser typically means the website is not using HTTPS  or is using an invalid/expired certificate.
## Why does the second site show up as "trusted" to the browser?
It has a valid SSL/TLS certificate issued by a recognized Certificate Authority or the domain matches the certificate. The connection is encrypted with HTTPS.
## What other ways are there to detect a phishing/scam site? Are there any tools available online?
- Check the URL carefully for mispelling
- Look at the certificate details by clicking the lock
- Suspicious page content
- Reputation tools: Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal, PhishTank, SSL Labs Server Test


## What is typosquatting and how does it relate to the pictures?
Typosquatting means criminals registering domains that are very similar to a legitimate one, relying on users mistyping the address.
## What is UDRP and how does it help with combatting typosquatting?
Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy. It  resolves disputes over domain names. Domain owners can file a UDRP complaint if someone registers a confusingly similar domain.
