# Evolution of card fraud
As long as there have been payment cards there has always been fraud. There are several kinds of card fraud: card-not-present (CNP), point-of-sale (POS), and ATM frauds. POS and ATM frauds can be categorized into four seperate frauds: counterfeit, card-not-received, lost-and-stolen and other. Lost-and-stolen frauds happen domestically since criminals have short window of time to exploit the stolen card before it's reported as missing to the authorities and thus deactivated. Counterfeit fraud happens mostly cross-border and not domestically. Frauds constantly change and evolve with technology and counter measures. From year 2008 to 2010 total number of frauds has declined however CNP fraud has become more common when ATM and POS fraud has become less relevant. Going towards year 2019 ATM frauds have declined significantly and POS frauds have also become less common. Card-not-present fraud has become the dominant fraud type during last decade. Despite all these frauds counter measures have been implemented. Measures such as cooperative fraud prevention, international standards, EMV and 3-D secure have had most significant impact on card fraud. Transaction landscape has also changed with Magnetic stripe cards becomimg even less relevant, decreasing risks of fraud linked to using them. Payments via internet have become inceasingly popular over traditional payment methods thus inceasing criminals interest to exploit them. Internet and e-commerce have increased amount of transactions done in internet, escpesially cross-border-transactions when people order items cross border.
